# Ruby Managers and Installers

If you have [installed GraalVM](installing-graalvm.md), it is recommended to add
TruffleRuby to a Ruby manager. See
[Configuring Ruby managers for the full GraalVM distribution](#configuring-ruby-managers-for-the-full-graalvm-distribution)
below.

## Installing TruffleRuby with RVM, ruby-build or ruby-install

TruffleRuby is supported by the 3 major Ruby installers.

### RVM

Upgrade RVM to let RVM know about the latest TruffleRuby release:

```bash
rvm get head
```

Install the latest TruffleRuby release with:

```bash
rvm install truffleruby
```

You can also install the latest nightly build of TruffleRuby with:

```bash
rvm install truffleruby-head
```

### ruby-build and rbenv

We assume you already have [`ruby-build`](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build)
installed as a plugin for [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

First, you need to upgrade `ruby-build` to get the latest TruffleRuby
definition. See [`ruby-build`'s instructions for upgrading](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#upgrading).

On macOS, if `ruby-build` is installed via Homebrew and you do not see the
[latest TruffleRuby release](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/releases/latest),
you might need to install the HEAD version of `ruby-build` with:

```bash
brew reinstall --HEAD ruby-build
```

Check the latest available version of TruffleRuby with:

```bash
rbenv install --list | grep truffleruby
```

Then install the latest TruffleRuby release with:

```bash
rbenv install truffleruby-[LATEST_VERSION]
```

You can also install the latest nightly build of TruffleRuby with:

```bash
rbenv install truffleruby-dev
```

### ruby-install and chruby

First, you need at least `ruby-install` 0.7.1 to get TruffleRuby support.
Check your version with:

```bash
ruby-install --version
```

If it is older than `0.7.1`, you need to update to latest `ruby-install`.
Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#install),
since the steps for upgrading `ruby-install` are the same as the steps for
installing it.

Then install the latest TruffleRuby release with:

```bash
ruby-install --latest
ruby-install truffleruby
```

`ruby-install` does not support installing nightly builds.
Please use `ruby-build` (which also works with `chruby`) if you want to install nightly builds:

```bash
ruby-build truffleruby-dev ~/.rubies/truffleruby-dev
```

There are also instructions on the
[chruby wiki](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/wiki/TruffleRuby)
if you prefer to install TruffleRuby manually.

## Configuring Ruby Managers for the Full GraalVM Distribution

When [installing GraalVM and Ruby](installing-graalvm.md), it is recommended to add
TruffleRuby to a Ruby manager for ease of use.

Make sure you ran the post-install script *before* adding GraalVM to Ruby managers.

Then follow these steps to integrate GraalVM with your Ruby manager.

The first step is to find the TruffleRuby home.
On macOS, run:
```bash
ruby_home=$(path/to/graalvm/Contents/Home/bin/ruby -e 'print RbConfig::CONFIG["prefix"]')
```

On Linux and other platforms, run:
```bash
ruby_home=$(path/to/graalvm/bin/ruby -e 'print RbConfig::CONFIG["prefix"]')
```

### rbenv

To add TruffleRuby to `rbenv`, create a symbolic link in the `versions` directory
of rbenv:

```bash
ln -s "$ruby_home" "$RBENV_ROOT/versions/truffleruby"
rbenv shell truffleruby
ruby --version
```

### chruby

To add TruffleRuby to `chruby`, create a symbolic link to the `$HOME/.rubies` directory:

```bash
ln -s "$ruby_home" "$HOME/.rubies/truffleruby"
chruby truffleruby
ruby --version
```

### RVM

RVM has a command for adding a precompiled Ruby to the list of available rubies.

```bash
rvm mount "$ruby_home" -n truffleruby
rvm use ext-truffleruby
ruby --version
```

### asdf (with asdf-ruby plugin)

Adding Truffleruby to asdf functions much like `rbenv` or `chruby`, create a symbolic link in the `.installs/ruby` directory but you also need to reshim:

```bash
ln -s "$ruby_home" "$HOME/.asdf/installs/ruby/truffleruby"
asdf reshim ruby truffleruby
asdf local ruby truffleruby
ruby --version
```

## Using TruffleRuby without a Ruby Manager

If you are using a Ruby manager like `rvm`, `rbenv`, or `chruby` and wish not to
add TruffleRuby to one of them make sure that the manager does not set
environment variables `GEM_HOME` and `GEM_PATH`. The variables
are picked up by TruffleRuby (as any other Ruby implementation would do)
causing TruffleRuby to pickup the wrong Gem home instead of its own.

It can be fixed for the current terminal by clearing
the environment with one of the following commands:

```bash
rbenv system
chruby system
rvm use system
# Or manually:
unset GEM_HOME GEM_PATH
```
