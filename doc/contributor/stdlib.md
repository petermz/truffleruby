## Standard gems

See https://stdgems.org.

> Default gems: These gems are part of Ruby and you can always require them
> directly. You cannot remove them. They are maintained by Ruby core.
> 
> Bundled gems: The behavior of bundled gems is similar to normal gems, but
> they get automatically installed when you install Ruby. They can be
> uninstalled and they are maintained outside of Ruby core.

It is not clear yet how installing default gems from RubyGems will work with
TruffleRuby in the future, as some default gems we use differ from the originals.

### Default gems

To list default gems, use:
```
gem list | grep default:
```

### Bundled gems

The list of bundled gems is available in MRI under `gems/bundled_gems`
```
cat gems/bundled_gems
```

* `did_you_mean` 1.3.0 (helper to suggest method names on method missing)
* `minitest` 5.11.3 (test framework)
* `net-telnet` 0.2.0
* `power_assert` 1.1.3
* `rake` 12.3.3 (hybrid bundled gem and standard library)
